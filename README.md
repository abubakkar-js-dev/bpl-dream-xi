## Project Overview
BPL Dream XI is an interactive React application where users can select and "purchase" Bangladeshi cricket players using a simulated budget. This project demonstrates various player selection and budget management features using dynamic data from a JSON file. 

In this application:
- Users can view players profiles, including images, roles, teams, and prices.
- They can add players to their team, monitor balance, and toggle between available and selected players.
- A "Claim Free Credit" feature allows users to add funds to their balance by clicking a button.

## Features
1. **Toggle Between Available and Selected Players**: Seamless toggling between available and selected player sections, enhancing the user experience.
2. **Player Selection Validation**: Ensures users can't select more than six players and notifies if a player is already chosen.
3. **Interactive Player Management**: Includes options to view, select, and remove players with immediate balance updates, using React Toastify for feedback.
